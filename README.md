This will be a log of my current coding activities, which will revolve around manual coding (with no AI assistance) in order to foster deep understanding and problem-solving skills.

The current main goal is to master SQL, and later I plan to focus on Python.
However, to master SQL I also need to work on simple ETL pipelines that will feed my database with data.
As for the database, I will be using my PostgreSQL from DigitalOcean, mainly used as a storage for the market data I'm regularly collecting (multi-timeframes, multiple symbols - indices, forex, crypto).

The goal here is not to create big data applications, but rather learn, test, and develop working solutions in a small scale.
I might be using AI after working on a given project to evaluate the code.
