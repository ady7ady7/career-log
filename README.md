This will be a log of my current coding activities, which will revolve around manual coding (with no AI assistance) in order to foster deep understanding and problem-solving skills.

The current main goal is to master SQL, and later I plan to focus on Python.
However, to master SQL I also need to work on simple ETL pipelines that will feed my database with data.
As for the database, I will be using my PostgreSQL from DigitalOcean, mainly used as a storage for the market data I'm regularly collecting.

The goal here is not to create big data applications, but rather learn, test, and develop working solutions in a small scale.
I might be using AI after working on a given project to evaluate the code.

- I've created a Selenium instance, connected to a few sites and successfully got past the cookie button. Issues with scraping data from wakacje.pl - xpath imports seem to fail
 with Error: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element - even though I'm grabbing the seemingly correct elements by their XPATH. Doesn't work either solo or in a loop. The goal here
 is to be able to scrape them nicely and then put in a table. (2-3 hrs)
- I've also studied Microsoft's Power BI Course (1.5 hrs) and made some notes during that time. Feels like a perfect direction for me now.

- I've completed the first day of my SQL for Data Analysis course, found and joined a Data Science community on Discord, where I did a basic research of current market situation, job requirements and learning possibilities (2 hrs)
- Studied Microsoft Power BI Course (2 hrs) - some notes and practice of different chart tpes - bar/column/pie/donut/treemap/line/stacked bar/columns - so far it seems to be very intuitive, and best learned through practice and multiple analysis/business cases
- Another scraping attempt with Selenium (scraping1-selenium.py) - I managed to skip the Cookie button again with locating and using .click() function, using Selenium's By method to identify the button by its XPATH. Failed to go further and actually scrape the top premieres from the ranking - even though the XPATH seems to be alright, Selenium is not able to find it - perhaps it's an issue connected with the iframes, but I didn't yet solve it. I might try again tomorrow (1hr)

- Started the day with exercises from my SQL course - it took me some time and I had to check Postgresql docs (very useful btw), but I managed to correctly do a JOIN of two tables and extract data about distinct number of buyers who have purchased something at least once (1:M table relation) (1hr)
Postgresql docs - https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/queries-table-expressions.html
- Followed up with an exercise from Datalemur - had serious issues here - even though it was labeled as easy, it required fairly complex subquery in my opinion (30 min). This task already required dividing into more subtasks - I've managed to get the first subtask done correctly, failed to do the second one though.
- Finished the first module of Microsoft's Power BI Course - going with high intensity here (2.5 hrs), the plan is to run through the course to ground my knowledge, and then upkeep and level up by doing regular report and dashboards based on free datasets
