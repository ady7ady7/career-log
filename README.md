This will be a log of my current coding activities, which will revolve around manual coding (with no AI assistance) in order to foster deep understanding and problem-solving skills.

The current main goal is to master SQL, and later I plan to focus on Python.
However, to master SQL I also need to work on simple ETL pipelines that will feed my database with data.
As for the database, I will be using my PostgreSQL from DigitalOcean, mainly used as a storage for the market data I'm regularly collecting (multi-timeframes, multiple symbols - indices, forex, crypto).

The goal here is not to create big data applications, but rather learn, test, and develop working solutions in a small scale.
I might be using AI after working on a given project to evaluate the code.

- I've created a Selenium instance, connected to a few sites and successfully clicked the cookie button. Issues with scraping data from wakacje.pl - xpath imports seem to fail
 with Error: Message: no such element: Unable to locate element - even though I'm grabbing the seemingly correct elements by their XPATH. Doesn't work either solo or in a loop. The goal here
 is to be able to scrape them nicely and then put in a table. (2-3 hrs)
- I've also studied Microsoft's Power BI Course (1.5 hrs) and made some notes during that time. Feels like a perfect direction for me now.

- I've completed the first day of my SQL for Data Analysis course, found and joined a Data Science community on Discord, where I did a basic research of current market situation, job requirements and learning possibilities (2 hrs)
- Studied Microsoft Power BI Course (2 hrs) - some notes and practice of different chart tpes - bar/column/pie/donut/treemap/line/stacked bar/columns - so far it seems to be very intuitive, and best learned through practice and multiple analysis/business cases
