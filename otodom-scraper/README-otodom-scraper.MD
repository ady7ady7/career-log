I decided to put this project in a separate folder - while it's working I also want to practice and demonstrate my skills of dividing that code in a nice and clean set of files that cooperate together and are divided in a logical structure.
Even though the original file DID NOT EXCEED 200 lines and it should be readable, I thought I might improve it a bit and practice this way.
